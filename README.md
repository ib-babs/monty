The Monty language
**Monty 0.98** is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. 
> The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

*Please use the following data structures for this project. Donâ€™t forget to include them in your header file.*

`/**`
` * struct stack_s - doubly linked list representation of a stack (or queue)`
 `* @n: integer`
 `* @prev: points to the previous element of the stack (or queue)`
 `* @next: points to the next element of the stack (or queue)`
 `*`
 `* Description: doubly linked list node structure`
 `* for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO`
 `*/`
`typedef struct stack_s`
`{`
`        int n;`
        `struct stack_s *prev;`
        `struct stack_s *next;`
`} stack_t;`
`/**`
 `* struct instruction_s - opcode and its function`
 `* @opcode: the opcode`
 `* @f: function to handle the opcode`
 `*`
 `* Description: opcode and its function`
 `* for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO`
 `*/`
`typedef struct instruction_s`
`{`
        `char *opcode;`
        `void (*f)(stack_t **stack, unsigned int line_number);`
`} instruction_t;`

Compilation & Output
Your code will be compiled this way:
`$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty`

Any output must be printed on stdout
Any error message must be printed on stderr
[Here is a  link](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/NUGvCZqs609VjEHeutkICw) to a GitHub repository that could help you making sure your errors are printed on stderr
